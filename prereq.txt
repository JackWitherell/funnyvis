numpy
glfw
pyopengl
pyopengl-accelerate
imgui
librosa
pyaudio

install all above using `pip install package` where package is the name of the package
for example
pip install numpy
pip install glfw
pip install pyo...
etc.

you will also need a copy of ffmpeg.exe which you can get from gyan.dev here:
https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/
I recommend ffmpeg-release-essentials.zip in the release builds section.

You can either add ffmpeg to your path or place ffmpeg.exe specifically into the program folder alongside fabby.py
