numpy
pyopengl
pyopengl-accellerate (optional) (not tested)
imgui[glfw,opengl] (just imgui on mac)
librosa
pyaudio

install all above using `pip install package` where package is the name of the package

you will also need a copy of ffmpeg.exe which you can get from gyan.dev here:
https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/
I recommend ffmpeg-release-essentials.zip in the release builds section.
